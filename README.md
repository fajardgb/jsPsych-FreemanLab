# Introduction
Welcome! [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) is a great tool for conducting online (and in person) experiments. More and more psychologists have begun using it - it‚Äôs almost at 1k stars on GitHub! Implementing it on our server is also super straightforward and easy to use (and already set up). 

Our lab‚Äôs current way of running online experiments is very outdated (Jon hired a software engineer to set it up around 2012). Some scripts don‚Äôt run anymore, certain links are broken, and there is no documentation - making it hard to fix bugs/issues and customize parameters. Not to mention, you can‚Äôt use ChatGPT/Copilot üòÖ. 

When writing these scripts, please make sure they are **well-commented and easily customizable**. **Try not to hard code any parameters/settings** - make sure things are easily changeable. Here are some concrete examples of what I mean: 

- **Example 1**: when setting the image height/wide, make this changeable at the top of the script. 
- **Example 2**: when rating images, make it loop through a list/array of images/image_names - don‚Äôt make it so you have to call an image every time. 
- **Example 3**: When you say ‚Äúthis experiment takes {XXX} minutes to complete‚Äù in the instructions page, make sure that XXX is a variable at the top of your script

This is so folks who join the lab and are not as technologically inclined as you have an easier time setting up their own scripts üòÄ. 

As with any good psychology experiment, randomization is a must. Make sure there is an easy way to randomize your experiments, whether that be through jsPsych or creating a function that randomizes an array of image names. 

There are many great ready-to-go scripts and examples available [online](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/tree/main/examples). Feel free to use them - there is no need to start everything from scratch! 


# Getting Started
1. Go through the jsPsych [tutorials](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/tutorials/hello-world/). 
2. Indicate on **Slack which project you are working** on! We don‚Äôt want 2 people working on the same thing, and there is lots to choose from!
3. To start a script, use this function: 
```javascript
var sub_id = Math.random().toString().substr(2, 6); // generate random 6 digit number

var jsPsych = initJsPsych({
      show_progress_bar: true,
      on_finish: function () {
        console.log("End of experiment");
        jsPsych.data.get(localSave("csv", "sub-" + sub_id + "_data.csv"));
      },
    });
```
4. Include a brief **Consent** page at the start, **Instructions** page(s) explaining the task before they begin, and a **Demographics** page at the end!
   1. Check out the [consent template](https://github.com/fajardgb/jsPsych-FreemanLab/blob/main/consent.html), and the [demographics template](https://github.com/fajardgb/jsPsych-FreemanLab/blob/main/consent.html)!
4. Name each trial with an intuitive name. For data saving later
   1. E.g: don't call a raiting trial simply 'Task1'.
5. If you are working on a script that requires images/word_vectors, you can use your own images/words lists, and loop over them for the experiments. 
   1. upload sample images to GitHub?
6. Additinoal scripts to preprocess/clean/analyze the data would be great but not necessary at the moment :)... just something to think about!
7. Once done, push scripts to the github page!

# Projects
Ordered roughly by difficulty

## Survey: Demographics
See [template](https://github.com/fajardgb/jsPsych-FreemanLab/blob/main/demographics.html)!

Things that need change: 
1. Make this script be able to be integrated into **ALL** scripts.

## Survey: MRS, SPS, NFCS, RES, FT
Easy surveys - would be a good start. If interested in working on them let me know and I'll show you what the questions for them are! We have them implemented on Qualtrics, but not everyone has access to Qualtrics. 

## Survey: Consent Page
See [template](https://github.com/fajardgb/jsPsych-FreemanLab/blob/main/consent.html)!

Things that need change:
1. Make things less hard-coded, more fluid
   1. eg: change welcome to add variable for task_name to be defined above!
2. Make all the questions show up on the same page 
   1. Not sure if this is possible? Since different types (eg; mult choice, free responses, etc)
3. Make the script exit/quit if the user answers the political party **attention_check** question wrong
4. Make the script exit/quit if the user is not fluent in English.
5. Make this script be able to be integrated into **ALL** scripts. 

## Rating Images: single trait at a time

Implement a script that shows an image, and asks to rate it on a specific trait with 
1. scale
2. slider

Customizability:
1. be able to easily change trait word (thin you are rating image on)
2. be able to change scale easily (eg: from 1-7)

## Rating Images: two traits at a time

Same as above, but asks particpants to rate an image on 2 traits at a time!

## Rating Images: N traits at a time

Same as above, but with N traits!

## FreeResponse Images/Words: one at a time
This one is already done, but could add more comments/customizability. 

See the [code](https://github.com/fajardgb/jsPsych-FreemanLab/tree/main/GF_antonyms)!

## FreeResponse Rate PairwiseSimilarity

May need this for IAC model project! 

See this [paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1807222115?doi=10.1073/pnas.1807222115) for a description of the task. 

I implemented this already, see this [example](https://github.com/fajardgb/jsPsych-FreemanLab/tree/main/GF_pairwise_sim). This might already work, but needs to be fleshed out more. 

Needed: 
1. Need each target trait to be compared with each other trait. 

## Passive Viewing of Images (or 1-back)
Passively view images. Each image is shown for 2s, ISI of 2-6s (randomly sampled to start with). 

Needed: 
1. Add probe condition, for 1-back task, so some images are repeated twice in a row. If an image is repeated, the participant should press a button. 

## Mousetracking
Implement any mousetracking script!

## Implicit Association Test (IAT)
I made this one for a post-scan task, but it is embarassingly hard coded. See the example. 

Needed: 
1. make things not hard-coded and more customizable



## Videos: Rate at end
Watch a video, rate it after it is over

## Videos: Rate halfway throug
Watch a video, be able to pause/rate it halfway thorugh.

## Videos: FreeResponse (halfway through at end also)
Watch a video, and make it be able to input a word halfway through the video

Make it be pausable? 



## Semantic Decision Task

Prime participant with an image, then ask them to respond (categorize) a word (eg: as good or bad)

## Who-Said-What task

3 phases: encoding, distractor, retrieval

Encoding:
- show face for 3s, 2-4s ISI, 7s face + sentence

Distractor: 
- show X dots on the screen, followed by a number. Respond if the number is less than or more than the number of dots shown prior. 

Retrieval:
- Show sentence, 2-4s ISI, 6s grid
- Make a red box around the grid - they can move it around left to right to make decision about WHO-SAID-WHAT
